# twisted-purity

This repository contais code computing twisted purities, accompanying paper "Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures" by Mykola Semenyakin, Yevheniia Cheipesh and Yaroslav Herasymenko (arXiv:2309.07956). The code is essentially using QuSpin library, for installation see

Also notice that for historical reasons in this repository we nicknamed "twisted purities" by "higher Pluckers".
